# ðŸ”— Soft Skills
Soft skills and assertive communication are very important for someone in AppSec, **really** important, almost more so than hard skills! This is because it's part of everyday life to talk to devs who are at the most varied career levels, from the intern to the well-known distinguished engineer in twitter. At these times it's not enough to say: "this code is bad, fix it". It's expected that someone from AppSec will become a reference, have some flexibility, be malleable (life isn't binary, right?) and know how to talk to and explain things to people who aren't always likely to agree with you, and who usually don't have a security background.

"Yeah, but this is still a vulnerability, right?"! Yes, until you have to explain why a vulnerability that can only be executed in a restricted environment is critical and needs to be fixed as a priority in the face of a tight backlog, with release dates due. At these times it's the soft skills that come into play: fixes take up time in the dev's sprint and with other things they need to deliver. Acting with empathy towards the dev, learning to demonstrate to non-technical people how a risk can become a financial loss and remembering that **security doesn't accept risk, but clearly presents the probability of exploitation** will help you succeed on this front.
