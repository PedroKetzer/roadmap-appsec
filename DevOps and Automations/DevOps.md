# ðŸ”— DevOps and conveyor automation
Knowing DevOps and automation in Application Security is crucial to ensuring the integrity and security of applications. The continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) provided by DevOps allows for frequent updates, while security treadmill automation efficiently identifies and fixes vulnerabilities. This reduces the response time to threats, strengthening the application's security posture. It is common for the AppSec team to be responsible for setting up and maintaining security tools and automations. So this skill is paramount.
