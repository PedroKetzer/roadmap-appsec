# Cloud
Having knowledge of the cloud is crucial, as it allows for the efficient implementation of security practices in dynamic environments. In the cloud, applications can scale quickly, requiring an agile approach to security integration. In addition, an understanding of cloud tools and services is essential for automating processes. You don't need to know all the specifics of the various cloud service providers: by thoroughly understanding the concepts and knowing how to implement one of them, you'll find it easy to get by with others :-)
#### ðŸ’¡ Many cloud providers offer a "free tier", a period of free access to and use of their tools. Take advantage of it to study!
