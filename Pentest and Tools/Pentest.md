# Pentests and Tools
Being a relatively new area, the responsibilities of the AppSec professional can vary between companies (find out more about the different ways of doing AppSec [in this short video by SheHacksPurple](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vRsUjPyaZk8&list=PLI9RITMnVbyiNqF0_ZOR09bzn6y83h5Pp&index=10)). That said, in many companies it will be common for the pentest activity to also be an AppSec activity, so it's essential that you know about vulnerability discovery, as a complement to your knowledge of code review and the use of code analysis tools. On this front, the most commonly used tool will be ðŸ’° [BurpSuite](https://portswigger.net/burp). It's highly recommended that you take the [free course they offer](https://portswigger.net/web-security) and **optionally** get a cert from them, if you have a little money to spare (today it's around 100 dollars).

Other courses that can help you develop your knowledge of vulnerability discovery (some also have a certification exam!):
- ðŸ’° [TCM Sec Academy](https://academy.tcm-sec.com/)
- [Portswigger Academy](https://portswigger.net/web-security/all-labs)
- ðŸ’° [Offensive Security](https://www.offsec.com/)

A good way to practice exploiting vulnerabilities is to use CTF platforms, where you can put into practice what you learn in the courses, and you can also consult writeups on the internet on how to exploit certain vulnerabilities, and expand your ability to think outside the box with practical examples. Below are some CTF platforms, both in free and paid versions:
