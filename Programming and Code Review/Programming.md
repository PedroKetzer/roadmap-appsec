# Programming and Code Review
I think this is the most obvious of all: there is no Application Security without the Application xD. When it comes to programming within the world of AppSec, the person working with it needs to be programming language agnostic. Contrary to what often happens in the Dev world, there is no discussion of which language is "better or worse": there are simply the languages that your company works with. If your company's stack involves Cobol, Erlang and Pascal, you need to be able to code review in those languages and that's that. ~Of course, this is hyperbole to make clear the expectations your team/bosses you have upon you~. Obviously, if you enter the job as a entry-level or even a Full-timer, in some cases you will be allowed to have a learning curve. But the focus here is that you may have a favorite language, but every one you touch, you need to be able to perform a code review.

When it comes to choosing a starting language, consider choosing a high-level backend language to make your first contact easier. Forget frameworks and abstractions at first. During your professional evolution as an AppSec, you will realize the need to learn at least one language from each of the main paradigms on the market (imperative, object-oriented, functional and event-driven). Understanding "programming logic" as a way of thinking and solving problems, "paradigms" are different forms of logical chaining to arrive at a solution (you were fooled when you were told there was only one form of programming logic, weren't you? ;-) ). If you want to get to the top of the technical career ladder, you need to talk to a dev on this topic!
