# Reason for the repo:
This repository was created with the intention of ~spreading the word of DevSecOps~ to educate and direct aspiring security professionals to a place that is different from the famous choice between the blue team and the red team, that place being the wonderful (and challenging) world of Application Security: a relatively new area, but one that is constantly expanding, with its own unique peculiarities. It's also a way I've found to repay what the community has done for me, because I didn't get to where I am on my own and many people have guided and directed me so that I can be a little better every day.

## Who can contribute?
Any AppSec professional is welcome to contribute and add insights!

## Why and for whom is AppSec?
You may already have the answer in your head, but there are those who may be undecided: The AppSec area (at least in Brazil, in my view) encompasses those professionals who don't want to make a living solely from pentesting. Of course, the idea of Red Team is fantastic and attracts a lot of people to the area (the Mr. Robot series probably brought more people to the area than any other professional or course in existence), but in a way it's a very common opinion in AppSec circles that it's difficult to find companies that take the Red Team concept literally. In addition, for those who have learned programming or even been devs, will have an easier transition and will use this knowledge much more within AppSec. This is not to say that in other areas we don't need to program, **not at all**, but anyone who likes or has already become professional through coding and has an interest in security will feel at home in AppSec (obviously, everyone will have a different experience of this).

##### ðŸ’¡TL;DR - If you don't want to be a Red Team and want to do pentests, if you've been a dev but want to be in security, AppSec is for you! In many companies, AppSecs also do pentests :D

## Can I start straight from this repo?
It's understood that if you've reached this repo, in most cases it's because you already know that AppSec is a niche and you already know the basics of SegInfo, perhaps with the exception of programming. Don't know? Not sure? Go back a few steps and [study the beginner content of this roadmap](https://roadmap.sh/cyber-security). It's essential because a lot of the content here will only make sense if you already have the basics down.
