# OWASP
As of today, OWASP is your best friend. If you don't know who OWASP is and haven't used Google before, check out [here](https://owasp.org/about/). Below are some of OWASP's main projects. Note that OWASP has [more than 300 projects](https://owasp.org/projects/), and this list is based on experience and may vary from company to company.

### OWASP Top 10
The biggest project you need to follow is the [Top 10](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/). The OWASP Top 10 is a collection of the top 10 security threats identified by organizations. Updated from time to time, it consists of eight top ones raised through data analysis, considering "prevalence" rather than number of tests, and two orchestrated by the community. Note that when we talk about the "OWASP Top 10", we usually mean the Top 10 web vulnerabilities. However, OWASP provides a [Top 10 Mobile](https://owasp.org/www-project-mobile-top-10/), [API](https://owasp.org/API-Security/editions/2023/en/0x11-t10/), LLM, among others. It's very important to identify what makes the most sense in the context of your company!

#### ðŸ’¡ In addition to this extreme relevance, the Top 10 is by far the most asked about topic in entry-level interviews: they usually ask for the concept of one or more vulnerabilities, how to identify it in the code, how it can be exploited and what the suggested fix would be!

### ASVS/MASVS
The ASVS (Application Security Verification Standard) is a set of security requirements and controls used to evaluate and verify the security of applications. It provides a detailed framework to ensure that applications are protected against common threats. MASVS (Mobile Application Security Verification Standard), on the other hand, is an extension of ASVS specifically designed to assess the security of mobile applications. It establishes specific guidelines and requirements to ensure robust security on mobile platforms, addressing unique threats associated with mobile applications. These two projects are valuable tools for developers and AppSecs, supporting them as checklists for gathering security requirements and supporting Threat Modeling:

- [MASVS - Mobile Application Security Verification Standard](https://github.com/OWASP/owasp-masvs/releases/latest/download/OWASP_MASVS.pdf)

### Cheatsheets
OWASP Cheatsheets is a resource consisting of quick reference documents containing practical guidelines and advice for addressing specific security challenges in software development. These cheatsheets are designed to help implement good security practices during the software development lifecycle and cover a variety of topics, from secure coding to mitigating specific threats, providing detailed and actionable information to improve application security. This project often comes in handy when dealing with developers with less experience in security, as it provides code examples in specific languages, with practical solutions that they can reuse.

### OWASP Testing Guide

#### [WSTG - Web Security Testing Guide](https://owasp.org/www-project-web-security-testing-guide/)
The OWASP WSTG project produces the leading security testing resource for web application developers and security professionals. The WSTG is a comprehensive guide to testing the security of web applications and services. Created by the collaborative efforts of cyber security professionals and dedicated volunteers, the WSTG provides a framework of best practices used by pentesters and organizations around the world.
#### [MASTG - Mobile Security Testing Guide](https://mas.owasp.org/MASTG/)
The OWASP Mobile Application Security Testing Guide (MASTG) is a comprehensive manual for mobile application security testing and reverse engineering. It describes technical processes for verifying the controls listed in the OWASP MASVS.
